INSTRUCTIONS FOR SAVING THE FOUNDER'S PORTRAIT IMAGE

1. Save the black and white portrait image you shared as "founder-portrait.jpg"
2. Place this file in the "public" folder of your project at:
   D:\Projects\Web Dev\Nishanth Project\portfolio\public\

This will allow the image to be displayed correctly in the About section of your website.

After saving the image, you can deploy your website again with:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Added founder portrait image"
git push
npm run deploy
```
